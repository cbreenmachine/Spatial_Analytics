# urban_analytics_in_R

This repository holds scripts to analyze many different phenomena (e.g. motor vehicle accidents in New York City, Nitrous Dioxide Pollution, and land usage information). The scripts in this repository are assignments and projects created for PLAN 590: Urban Analytics in R, a course taught by [Professor Kaza](http://sia.planning.unc.edu/#about) at UNC-Chapel Hill. 


## This Repository
This repository contains folders that should contain code and data that is ready to run in any machine equipped with R. Most output figures are included as well, although some mapping libraries in R do not transfer easily to Github (actively working to render clean Jupyter Notbeook-esque files).
