# urban_analytics

This repository holds scripts to analyze many different phenomena (e.g. motor vehicle accidents in New York City, Nitrous Dioxide Pollution, and land usage information). The scripts in this repository are assignments and projects created for PLAN 590: Urban Analytics in R, a course taught by (Professor Kaza)[http://sia.planning.unc.edu/#about] at UNC-Chapel Hill.
